# Basic-Algorithm-Practice

This project solved three separate algorithm problems:
  1. Program that generates all permutations of the characters in a string
  2. Recursive function that takes a positive integer num (base 10) and a base b (int from 2 to 16) and returns a string representing the base b number
  3. Teddy Bear Reachability Problem: given a set of mathematical rules and an integer, determine if the rules can be applied to the integer recursively in a way that the target value of 42 can be reached.
